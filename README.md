VSC with Grid-Forming strategies (Droop-Control)

VSC_3phVoltageSource   is a basic model, which includes VSC and 3ph Voltage source

File VSC_GridFroming_Thesis_Script_withSynchMach.m constains all the data of the electric network, parameters of the Inverter and its controllers

VSC_3phVoltageSource_VirtImp.   a VSC with an implemented Virtual impedance block, which helps to reduce the current magnitude in the inverter during a fault condition (3ph Short-circuit and 1ph-Ground) and a 3ph Voltage source

VSC_GridFroming_Thesis_Script_withSynchMach   a VSC with an implemented Virtual impedance block  and a Synchronous machine

VSC_InfiniteBus_VirtualImp_CurrentLimit    a VSC with an implemented Virtual impedance block and current reference limitation  and a Synchronous machine
